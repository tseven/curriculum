# What is Docker?
---

## Content

Docker is an open-source tool designed to make it easier to create, run and deploy applications by using containers.

The core idea of Docker comes down to the following concept: “_develop once, run anywhere_”.

Using Docker we can package our application with all of its dependencies into a single container. This containerized application can be tested and built on a developer's local machine, then easily deployed to any Docker-enabled server without the need to re-test or re-adjust the container to the server environment.

Docker enables us to separate our applications from our infrastructure so we can deliver software quickly. Developers can focus on writing the application code without worrying a lot about the system that it will ultimately be running on.
